Exifography displays EXIF data for images and enables import of latitude and longitude EXIF to the database.

== Description ==

Exifography (formerly Thesography) displays EXIF data for images uploaded with WordPress. It utilises WordPressâ€™ own feature of storing EXIF fields in the database, and also enables import of latitude and longitude, and flash fired EXIF to the database upon image upload.

The purpose of this plugin is to make dislaying EXIF data as convenient as possible, while using as much of WordPress' native image handling as possible.

EXIF can be displayed via a shortcode, via a function in your theme files and it can be inserted automatically for the first image attached to a post.

Features include:
* Location shown as coordinates or static Google map, and linked to Google maps (or not)
* Customisable HTML layout via plugin options
* All output can be manipulated via a filter
* Language localisation

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Visit the Exifography Options page under the WordPress Settings menu.
1. See the [Exifography plugin page](http://www.kristarella.com/exifography/) for instructions on EXIF display.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use Exifography to display EXIF for my Flickr images? =

No. Exifography uses data imported to the WordPress database upon image upload. Only images uploaded with WordPress will have their EXIF data available to Exifography.

= Can automatic insertion be used with themes other than Thesis? =

Yes! Previously this plugin was called Thesography because I built it to use with Thesis, but that same functionality is available for all themes now.

= Why did you change the name? =

See the above answer.

== Screenshots ==

1. Options Page allows you to set default post options for EXIF display and customise the HTML output of EXIF for styling.
2. Each post can have its own EXIF items displayed.
